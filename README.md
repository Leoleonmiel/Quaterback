# 🏈 Quarterback Game

## 📌 Overview  
**Quarterback Game** is a local **1v1 strategy game** played on the same screen. Developed using **C++** and **SFML**, this project was built over **10 days** (including production and pre-production) spread across **10 weeks** while learning the SFML framework.

## 🎯 Game Objective  
The goal of this project was to create a **board game concept** and adapt it into a digital format.

In **1v1 local mode**, players take turns eliminating enemy units. Each time an enemy unit is defeated, a **ball spawns** in the player's field. The player must retrieve the ball using one of their remaining units and carry it into the opponent’s zone to **score a point**. Scoring a point rewards the player with a **bonus card** that provides a strategic advantage.

## 🛠️ Features  
- 🎲 **Turn-based strategy mechanics** inspired by chess and American football  
- 🔳 **Grid-based movement system** with pathfinding for optimal unit navigation  
- 🃏 **Bonus card system** to introduce tactical depth  
- 🖥️ **C++ and SFML-based development** for rendering and gameplay logic  

## 🔨 Development  
- 🏗️ Implemented a **grid-based system** for unit movement and interactions  
- 🧭 Designed **pathfinding logic** using **BFS, Dijkstra, and A***  
- 🔧 Maintained **game stability** throughout development  
- 🎨 Explored **visual enhancements** like shaders and color grading *(not implemented due to artistic direction)*  

## 🖥️ Technologies Used  
- 💻 **C++** for core game logic  
- 🎮 **SFML** for graphics and input handling  
- 🛠️ **Visual Studio** as the development environment  

## 🎮 How to Play  
1. 🏁 **Launch the game** and select a side.  
2. ⚔️ **Move your units** strategically to eliminate opponents.  
3. 🏉 **Retrieve the ball** that spawns after a successful elimination.  
4. 🏆 **Carry the ball** into the enemy zone to score.  
5. 🃏 **Use bonus cards** to gain an advantage and outplay your opponent.
